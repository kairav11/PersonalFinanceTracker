## Changelog

### [v1.0] — 2026-05-10 — Project complete: public repo ready
**Commit:** `6716c0e`  
**Branch:** `feature/streamlit-dashboard`

**Achieved:**
- Streamlit dashboard live on Streamlit Community Cloud (Python 3.12 enforced via UI setting + `runtime.txt`)
- `dashboard/app.py`: added project summary footer with GitHub repo link
- `.claude/settings.local.json` removed from git tracking (Claude local config, not project artefact)
- Full security audit passed: no secrets in tracked files, no sensitive files committed, git history clean
- All Day 7 manual validation checks passed (dedup, FX conversion, subscription detection, budget variance)
- Repo safe to make public

**Files changed:**
```
dashboard/app.py          (updated — project footer added)
docs/project_log.md       (updated)
```

**Known issues / follow-ups:**
- None — project is feature-complete

### [v0.7] — 2026-05-09 — Day 7 validation: YTD delta fix + gitignore hardening
**Commit:** `b2cfabb`  
**Branch:** `feature/streamlit-dashboard`

**Achieved:**
- `dashboard/app.py`: fixed YTD Net Savings delta — now correctly compares current-year net savings vs previous year's net for the same calendar months (not self-referential)
- `dashboard/app.py`: fixed delta string format using `:+,.2f` so Streamlit renders green/up arrow for positive deltas and red/down arrow for negative deltas (Streamlit requires string to start with `+` or `-`, not `€`)
- `.gitignore`: restored `.claude` entry (Claude Code local settings); added `wealth_flow_dbt/package-lock.yml` (dbt-generated, should not be committed)
- End-to-end validation checklist run (see §9 of `project_spec.md`)

**Files changed:**
```
dashboard/app.py          (updated — YTD delta logic + color fix)
.gitignore                (updated — .claude + package-lock.yml entries)
docs/project_log.md       (updated)
```

**Known issues / follow-ups:**
- None — project complete

**Updated status table rows:**

### [v0.6] — 2026-05-09 — Streamlit dashboard complete
**Commit:** `3b5456e`  
**Branch:** `feature/streamlit-dashboard`

**Achieved:**
- `dashboard/app.py`: 5-panel public dashboard reading Gold tables only
  - Panel 1: Monthly Burn — stacked bar by category (expenses only)
  - Panel 2: Budget Variance — grouped bar with month selector; captions over-budget categories
  - Panel 3: Income vs Expense — line chart with income, expense, net lines
  - Panel 4: Subscriptions — sortable dataframe sorted by monthly cost
  - Panel 5: YTD Summary — 3 KPI metric tiles at top of page
- All Databricks queries wrapped with `@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)` — 1-hour cache
- Empty state handled with `st.info()` per panel; connection errors show `st.error()`
- `dashboard/requirements.txt`: 5 dependencies pinned
- `dashboard/.streamlit/secrets.toml.example`: safe placeholder template (no real values)
- Verified working locally against live Gold tables

**Files changed:**
```
dashboard/app.py                              (created)
dashboard/requirements.txt                   (created)
dashboard/.streamlit/secrets.toml.example    (created)
docs/project_log.md                          (updated)
```

**Known issues / follow-ups:**
- Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud (Day 7 task — add secrets via Streamlit UI)
- Use a separate read-only Databricks token for the dashboard (currently using the same ingestion token)

### [v0.5] — 2026-05-09 — GitHub Actions workflows live
**Commit:** pending  
**Branch:** `feature/github-actions`

**Achieved:**
- `pipeline.yml`: full pipeline on 3-day cron + manual dispatch — Sheets ingest → seed → Silver run → Silver test (--fail-fast) → Gold run
- `csv_ingest.yml`: triggered on push to `csv_uploads/*.csv` — CSV ingest → Silver → test → Gold
- `ci.yml`: runs on every PR — `dbt compile` + `dbt test --select silver --fail-fast` to block broken models from merging
- All workflows: `permissions: contents: read`, Actions pinned to commit SHA, secrets referenced via `${{ secrets.NAME }}` only, no `set -x`

**Files changed:**
```
.github/workflows/pipeline.yml    (created)
.github/workflows/csv_ingest.yml  (created)
.github/workflows/ci.yml          (created)
docs/project_log.md               (updated)
```

**Known issues / follow-ups:**
- `actions/setup-python` SHA should be verified against the latest v5 release tag before merging
- CSV file moves (`processed/`) do not persist in CI since the runner is ephemeral — data integrity maintained by Silver deduplication on `transaction_id`

### [v0.4] — 2026-05-09 — dbt Gold layer complete
**Commit:** pending  
**Branch:** `feature/gold-dbt`

**Achieved:**
- `fct_monthly_burn`: monthly totals by category + type in EUR, with YTD running total partitioned by calendar year
- `fct_income_vs_expense`: monthly income vs expense with net cash flow and 3-month rolling average
- `fct_budget_variance`: actual spend vs configured budget per category per month; computes variance_eur, variance_pct, over_budget flag; nulls where no budget is set
- `dim_subscription_tracker`: detects recurring merchants (≥3 distinct months, charges within ±2% of median); outputs estimated monthly cost, first/last seen, occurrence count
- `gold/schema.yml`: tests on all Gold models — all passing

**Files changed:**
```
wealth_flow_dbt/models/gold/fct_monthly_burn.sql         (created)
wealth_flow_dbt/models/gold/fct_income_vs_expense.sql    (created)
wealth_flow_dbt/models/gold/fct_budget_variance.sql      (created)
wealth_flow_dbt/models/gold/dim_subscription_tracker.sql (created)
wealth_flow_dbt/models/gold/schema.yml                   (created)
docs/project_log.md                                      (updated)
```

**Known issues / follow-ups:**
- None — all Gold tests passing

### [v0.3] — 2026-05-09 — dbt Silver layer complete + Unity Catalog migration
**Commit:** pending  
**Branch:** `feature/silver-dbt`

**Achieved:**
- Built full dbt project structure: `dbt_project.yml`, `profiles.yml`, `packages.yml`, `macros/`, `seeds/`, `models/`
- `seeds/fx_rates.csv`: fixed FX rates (EUR=1.0, USD=0.926, INR=0.011) loaded into `workspace.silver.fx_rates`
- `macros/generate_schema_name.sql`: overrides dbt default so custom schemas are used as-is (e.g. `silver`, not `silver_silver`)
- `models/sources.yml`: declares `workspace.bronze.transactions` and `workspace.bronze.budgets` as dbt sources
- `silver/stg_transactions.sql`: deduplication (latest `_ingested_at` wins), type casting, string cleaning, FX join → `amount_eur`
- `silver/stg_budgets.sql`: casts `monthly_budget_eur` to DECIMAL, filters nulls
- `silver/schema.yml`: 19 tests — unique, not_null, accepted_values, expression_is_true — all passing
- **Unity Catalog discovery**: workspace uses UC (`workspace` catalog), not Hive Metastore. Fixed `profiles.yml` (`catalog: workspace`), `sources.yml`, and both ingestion scripts (three-part table names). All docs updated.
- Fixed `dbt_utils.expression_is_true` syntax: expression must be operator-only (e.g. `> 0`), not include the column name.

**Files changed:**
```
wealth_flow_dbt/dbt_project.yml              (created)
wealth_flow_dbt/profiles.yml                 (created)

wealth_flow_dbt/models/silver/stg_budgets.sql (created)
wealth_flow_dbt/models/silver/schema.yml     (created)
ingestion/ingest_bronze.py                   (updated — three-part table names)
ingestion/ingest_csv.py                      (updated — three-part table names)
project_plan.md                              (updated — UC throughout)
project_spec.md                              (updated — §5.3 UC naming)
CLAUDE.md                                    (updated — UC in dbt section + decisions table)
docs/project_log.md                          (this file)
```

**Known issues / follow-ups:**
- `dbt_packages/` (created by `dbt deps`) must not be committed — confirm it is in `.gitignore`
- Gold layer (`workspace.gold.*`) schemas do not exist yet — created in Day 4

**Updated status table rows:**

### [v0.2] — 2026-05-09 — Bronze ingestion complete
**Commit:** pending  
**Branch:** `feature/bronze-ingestion`

**Achieved:**
- `ingest_bronze.py`: reads Transactions + Budgets tabs from Google Sheet, validates all rows, appends to `bronze.transactions` (append-only), overwrites `bronze.budgets` (full refresh). Parameterized SQL throughout — no f-strings. 3-retry exponential backoff on Sheets and Databricks calls.
- `ingest_csv.py`: processes all `.csv` files in `csv_uploads/`, validates columns and rows, rejects files > 10 MB, moves processed files to `csv_uploads/processed/` (never deletes). `template.csv` is always skipped.
- `generate_dummy_data.py`: generates 6 months of realistic dummy transactions (salary, freelance, interest income + 9 expense categories) and pushes to Google Sheet. Run once to seed the Sheet before first pipeline run.
- `requirements.txt`: all 7 dependencies pinned to exact versions.
- End-to-end verified: 140 rows confirmed in `bronze.transactions`, 9 rows in `bronze.budgets`. All currency/type checks pass, no nulls on required columns.

**Files changed:**
```
ingestion/ingest_bronze.py      (created)
ingestion/ingest_csv.py         (created)
ingestion/generate_dummy_data.py (created)
ingestion/requirements.txt      (created)
docs/project_log.md             (updated)
```

**Known issues / follow-ups:**
- `generate_dummy_data.py` requires write scope on the service account (`spreadsheets` + `drive.file`). The production service account only has `spreadsheets.readonly` — grant Editor on the Sheet manually when running this script, then revert to Viewer.
- Databricks SQL Warehouse cold start adds 2–4 min to first run of the day; subsequent runs are fast.
- Row-by-row INSERTs are fine at current data volume; revisit if ingestion grows beyond ~10k rows/run.

### [v0.1] — 2026-05-09 — Infrastructure setup + project foundation
**Commit:** pending first push  
**Branch:** `main`

**Achieved:**
- Chose **Databricks Community Edition** (Hive Metastore) over trial — free forever, no Unity Catalog
- All table references updated to two-part `database.table` naming throughout all docs
- Databricks workspace live; `bronze`, `silver`, `gold` Hive databases created via notebook
- Google Cloud project created (`wealth-flow-495800`), Sheets API enabled, Service Account created
- Google Sheet created (`Wealth-Flow Tracker`) with `Transactions` + `Budgets` tabs and correct headers
- Sheet shared with service account; all 5 GitHub Secrets added
- `.gitignore` hardened: covers `.env`, `service_account.json`, Python/dbt artefacts
- **Security incident:** original service account key was briefly exposed in IDE; key was rotated immediately, new key in place
- All planning docs (`project_plan.md`, `project_spec.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) updated to reflect Community Edition

**Files created/modified:**
```
.gitignore          (created — comprehensive)
.env                (updated — removed DATABRICKS_CATALOG, updated comment)
project_plan.md     (updated — Unity Catalog → Hive Metastore throughout)
project_spec.md     (updated — table names, §5.3 Databricks connection)
CLAUDE.md           (updated — dbt catalog note, security constraint, decisions table)
docs/project_log.md (this file — updated status table + changelog)
```

**Known issues / follow-ups:**
- `ingestion/service_account.json` must be replaced with the newly rotated key before running any ingestion script
- GitHub Secrets `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` must also be updated with the new rotated key JSON

### [PLANNING] — 2026-05-09 — Pre-commit baseline
**Planning phase complete — superseded by v0.1 above.**

**Achieved:**
- Defined full project architecture (Medallion: Bronze / Silver / Gold)
- Finalised tech stack, all key design decisions resolved
- Created `project_plan.md`, `project_spec.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env`, `docs/project_log.md`
